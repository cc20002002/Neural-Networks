  abstract = 	 {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layerâ€™s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}

  abstract = 	 {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

This paper presents a comprehensive and competitive study in multi-class neural learning with focuses on issues including neural network architecture, encoding schemes, training methodology and training time complexity. Our study includes multi-class pattern classification using either a system of multiple neural networks or a single neural network, and modeling pattern classes using one-against-all, one-against-one, one-against-higher-order, and P-against-Q. We also discuss implementations of these approaches and analyze training time complexity associated with each approach. We evaluate six different neural network system architectures for multi-class pattern classification along the dimensions of imbalanced data, large number of pattern classes, large vs. small training data through experiments conducted on well-known benchmark data."

 abstract = {Wave propagation around and inside a harbor is conventionally studied by numerically solving a representative equation of short-wave progression or by taking actual measurements on a physical model. Although the numerical schemes yield workable solutions, underlying assumptions as well as noticeable difference between the resulting estimations and actual measurements leave scope to employ alternative approaches. The current study is an attempt in that direction and is based on the approach of neural networks. Modeled to imitate the biological neural network prevalent in human brains, an artificial neural network represents interconnection of computational elements called neurons or nodes, each of which basically carries out the task of combining inputs, determining their strength by comparing the combination with a bias (or alternatively passing it through a non-linear function) and firing out the result in proportion to such a strength. The network is first trained with examples, the strengths of interconnections (or weights) are accordingly fixed and then it is readied for application to unseen inputs. The applications of neural networks have now spread across all disciplines of ocean engineering, namely, harbor, coastal, offshore and deepocean engineering, and are directed towards function approximation, optimization, system modeling including parameter predictions. Advantages of the ANN schemes are improved accuracy, ease in application, reduced data requirement and so on. In the present work a feed forward modular neural network was developed in order to estimate attenuation of wave heights along the approach channel of a harbor starting from seaward boundary and ending at the harbor entrance. The trained network was found to satisfactorily follow the expected trend of wave height attenuation along the harbor channel. When tested for unseen input it yielded values of wave heights close to the numerical and physical models. The network also properly simulated the effect of variation of wave period as well as that of angle of wave attack on wave attenuation.},

abstract = "In this paper, we present bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and a modified, full gradient version of the LSTM learning algorithm. We evaluate Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) and several other network architectures on the benchmark task of framewise phoneme classification, using the TIMIT database. Our main findings are that bidirectional networks outperform unidirectional ones, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is much faster and also more accurate than both standard Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) and time-windowed Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results support the view that contextual information is crucial to speech processing, and suggest that BLSTM is an effective architecture with which to exploit it.11An abbreviated version of some portions of this article appeared in (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005), as part of the IJCNN 2005 conference proceedings, published under the IEEE copyright."

abstract = "Artificial neural networks are universal and highly flexible function approximators first used in the fields of cognitive science and engineering. In recent years, neural network applications in finance for such tasks as pattern recognition, classification, and time series forecasting have dramatically increased. However, the large number of parameters that must be selected to develop a neural network forecasting model have meant that the design process still involves much trial and error. The objective of this paper is to provide a practical introductory guide in the design of a neural network for forecasting economic time series data. An eight-step procedure to design a neural network forecasting model is explained including a discussion of tradeoffs in parameter selection, some common pitfalls, and points of disagreement among practitioners."
