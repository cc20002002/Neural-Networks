{This project numerically illustrates the effects of various state-of-the-art modules in a feed forward neural network by performing a ten-class classification task. Section~\ref{chapter1} briefly reviews relevant work in the field of neural network.  Section~\ref{chapter2} describes the empirical techniques applied in our neural network and their theoretical support. Numerical results from one-way sensitivity analysis (Section~\ref{chapter4}) agree with the theories. While our most accurate model has a $90.0\%$ cross validation accuracy, our best model achieves a cross validation accuracy of $89.9\%$ in $2.3$ minutes. Future work involves implementing the proposed backward propagation algorithm using the \textsc{nvidia} \textsc{gpu} based package \texttt{Cuda}.}
