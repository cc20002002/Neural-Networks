{This project numerically illustrates the functions of of various state-of-the-art modules in a feed forward neural network. Section~\ref{chapter1} briefly reviews relevant work in the field of neural network, which finds neural network may be the most powerful tool for classification task without a clear mathematical structure. Section~\ref{chapter2} describes the empirical techniques applied in our neural network and their theoretical support. Our simulation results in Section~\ref{chapter4} agree with the theoretical properties of the two algorithms. Future work involves embedding the proposed backward propagation into the \textsc{nvidia} \textsc{gpu} based parallel-programming model in the \texttt{Python} package \texttt{Numba}.}
