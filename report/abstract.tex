{This project numerically illustrates the effects of various state-of-the-art modules in a feed forward neural network by performing to classification task. Section~\ref{chapter1} briefly reviews relevant work in the field of neural network, which finds neural network may be the most powerful tool for classification task without a clear mathematical structure. Section~\ref{chapter2} describes the empirical techniques applied in our neural network and their theoretical support. Numerical results from one way sensitivity test (Section~\ref{chapter4}) agree with the theories. While our most accurate model has a $90.0\%$ CV accuracy, our best model achieves a CV accuracy of $89.9\%$ in $2.3$ minutes. Future work involves implementing the proposed backward propagation algorithm using the \textsc{nvidia} \textsc{gpu} based package \texttt{Cuda} through \texttt{Numba} in \texttt{Python}.}
